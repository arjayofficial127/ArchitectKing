Design Principles
-----------------

### Why boundaries matter more than cleverness

What this chapter is
--------------------

This chapter is not a checklist.It is not a style guide.It is not a collection of slogans.

This chapter explains **why design principles exist at all**.

They were not invented by committees.They were **discovered through failure**.

The core truth
--------------

Design principles are **damage control mechanisms**.

They exist because:

*   systems grow
    
*   people change
    
*   assumptions break
    
*   time passes
    

Good design is not about elegance.It is about **survivability**.

Principles are not rules
------------------------

Rules demand obedience.Principles demand judgment.

A principle does not say:

> “Always do this.”

It says:

> “If you ignore this, something predictable will go wrong.”

🧠 **Mental Model**Principles are warnings written in advance.

Separation of concerns: the foundation
--------------------------------------

When responsibilities mix:

*   changes collide
    
*   bugs hide
    
*   reasoning slows
    

Separation is not about purity.It is about **blast radius**.

If something breaks, how much breaks with it?

🧠 **Architect’s Note**A concern separated is a failure contained.

Boundaries create safety
------------------------

A boundary is a line you agree not to cross casually.

Boundaries answer:

*   what can change freely
    
*   what must remain stable
    
*   where assumptions stop
    

Without boundaries:

*   everything depends on everything
    
*   fear replaces confidence
    
*   refactoring becomes dangerous
    

🧠 **Perspective**Most “tight coupling” is actually missing boundaries.

Single Responsibility, correctly understood
-------------------------------------------

Single Responsibility does not mean:

> “One function does one thing.”

It means:

> “One reason to change.”

When code changes for multiple reasons:

*   fixes interfere
    
*   intent blurs
    
*   history accumulates
    

🧠 **Mental Model**If a change request feels ambiguous, responsibility is unclear.

DRY, without superstition
-------------------------

“Don’t Repeat Yourself” is often misapplied.

It does **not** mean:

*   eliminate all duplication
    
*   reuse aggressively
    
*   abstract early
    

It means:

> “A rule should have one authoritative definition.”

Duplication of _knowledge_ is the enemy.Duplication of _code_ is sometimes the price of clarity.

⚠️ **Common Drift**Premature abstraction spreads mistakes faster.

Coupling vs cohesion
--------------------

Cohesion:

*   things that belong together
    
*   shared purpose
    
*   aligned change
    

Coupling:

*   things that depend on each other
    
*   shared assumptions
    
*   forced coordination
    

High cohesion is good.High coupling is dangerous.

🧠 **Architect’s Note**Aim to increase cohesion before reducing coupling.

Cleverness is a liability
-------------------------

Clever code:

*   impresses briefly
    
*   confuses later
    
*   resists change
    

Clarity scales.Cleverness does not.

🧠 **Perspective**If code needs explanation, it is already fragile.

Design for change, not prediction
---------------------------------

You cannot predict:

*   future features
    
*   future scale
    
*   future teams
    

You _can_ predict:

*   change will happen
    
*   assumptions will break
    
*   pressure will arrive
    

Good design:

*   localizes change
    
*   limits impact
    
*   preserves invariants
    

Abstractions must earn their place
----------------------------------

An abstraction should:

*   remove repetition of reasoning
    
*   hide volatile details
    
*   clarify intent
    

If it only:

*   saves lines
    
*   feels elegant
    
*   looks reusable
    

…it is suspect.

🧠 **Mental Model**Abstractions should make misuse harder, not easier.

Design debt vs technical debt
-----------------------------

Technical debt is often blamed.Design debt is more dangerous.

Design debt appears when:

*   boundaries are skipped
    
*   responsibilities blur
    
*   shortcuts harden into structure
    

It compounds silently.

⚠️ **Common Drift**Most “legacy problems” began as reasonable shortcuts.

Minimal practice (still no code)
--------------------------------

**Problem:**“A module handles validation, persistence, logging, and notification.”

Ask:

*   How many reasons can this change?
    
*   Which changes should be independent?
    
*   Where should boundaries exist?
    

If the answers overlap, redesign is needed.

What beginners gain here
------------------------

*   A sense of restraint
    
*   Fewer “magic fixes”
    
*   Cleaner mental models
    

What experienced developers recognize
-------------------------------------

*   Why systems rot over time
    
*   Why refactors feel dangerous
    
*   Why clever designs age poorly
    

Principles were ignored.

What this chapter deliberately avoids
-------------------------------------

*   Named patterns
    
*   Framework opinions
    
*   Methodology wars
    
*   Dogma
    

Those are downstream.

Closing
-------

Design principles are not about beauty.They are about **longevity**.

Boundaries protect clarity.Clarity protects systems.Systems that hold protect people.

Choose boring design.Boring design survives.
