## PROJECT CONTEXT

You are expanding a set of architecture books created by a system architect.

Existing source materials exist in this folder:

* Architect_Master_Framework.zip
* Architect_Master_Framework_v2.zip
* Architect_Master_Framework_v3_Applied.zip
* Architect_Master_Framework_v4_Legendary.zip
* Architect_Master_Framework_v5_Architect_Codex.zip
* Architect_Master_Framework_v6_Living_Architect_System.zip

Your mission is NOT to rewrite randomly.

Your mission:

CONTINUOUSLY REBUILD and EVOLVE into THREE FINAL BOOKS.

---

## TARGET OUTPUT (FINAL STRUCTURE)

BOOK 1 — THE PEOPLE BOOK
Purpose:
Teach architecture thinking to humans (developers → architects).

Tone:
Narrative, inspiring, clear, deep but accessible.

Goal:
Feels like reading a powerful technical philosophy book.

Contains:

* System thinking explained deeply
* Real examples
* Mental models
* Architect journey
* Stories + lessons
* Practical exercises

---

BOOK 2 — THE SYSTEM CONTEXT BOOK
Purpose:
A HIGH-PRECISION context framework that can be fed to ANY AI.

Goal:
Given a ZIP or repo, AI can compare architecture and produce transformation guidance.

Contains:

* Architecture schemas
* Decision trees
* Analysis frameworks
* Checklists
* Transformation algorithms
* Reference templates
* Comparison methodology

Tone:
Precise, mechanical, deterministic, AI-readable.

---

BOOK 3 — THE ARCHITECT FICTION MANUAL (NON-FICTION STYLE)
Purpose:
Personal learning manual that reads like fiction but is technically real.

Tone:
Immersive.
Flowing.
Cinematic but technically accurate.

Rules:

* NO fantasy.
* NO fake stories.
* Real concepts explained through narrative progression.
* Reader feels like walking through architect evolution.

Goal:
High emotional engagement + deep technical clarity.

---

## GLOBAL RULES

1. DO NOT remove existing knowledge.
2. Merge overlapping ideas intelligently.
3. Eliminate duplication.
4. Increase clarity every iteration.
5. Preserve architecture hierarchy:

North Star
Conscious Layer
Meta Layer
Operating System
Invisible Layer
Engine
State
Projection

6. Every rewrite must improve:

* clarity
* depth
* structure
* readability
* practical value.

---

## ITERATIVE LOOP (CRITICAL)

After generating output, ALWAYS run:

STEP 1 — SELF REVIEW

* What is weak?
* What is repetitive?
* What lacks depth?
* What lacks examples?

STEP 2 — EXPAND

* Add missing depth.
* Add examples.
* Add diagrams (ASCII if needed).

STEP 3 — RESTRUCTURE

* Improve flow.
* Reorder chapters if needed.

STEP 4 — SIMPLIFY

* Remove fluff.
* Preserve precision.

STEP 5 — REPEAT.

Continue looping until:

CONDITION OF COMPLETION:

* Book feels publishable.
* No shallow explanations remain.
* Architecture progression is obvious.
* Reader transformation is clear.

---

## OUTPUT RULES

Create folder structure:

/BOOK_1_PEOPLE/
/BOOK_2_AI_CONTEXT/
/BOOK_3_ARCHITECT_MANUAL/

Each chapter must be separate markdown files.

Also generate:

MASTER_INDEX.md
which explains:

* reading order
* purpose of each book
* evolution notes.

---

## STYLE REQUIREMENTS

* Senior Architect voice.
* Clear hierarchy.
* No filler.
* Deep but understandable.

---

## CRITICAL ARCHITECT REQUIREMENT

Always think:

You are not writing books.

You are building an ARCHITECTURAL OPERATING SYSTEM FOR KNOWLEDGE.

Every section must reduce cognitive load.

---

BEGIN FULL EVOLUTION NOW.

DO NOT STOP EARLY.
KEEP REFINING UNTIL COMPLETE.
